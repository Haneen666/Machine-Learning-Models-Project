# 📊 Machine Learning Models Project

A **team project** focused on developing **Machine Learning models** for classification, prediction, and real-world data analysis.  

🚀 Developed collaboratively with a team, covering the full ML workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project includes multiple ML experiments:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Prediction on new data

The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.
